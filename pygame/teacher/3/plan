- *Open game.py*

- Collisions demo
    - 2 sprite groups, 4 colliding

- Checking for collisions
    - Every loop, pygame.sprite.groupcollide, arguments
    - returns dict, will learn in experiments, print statements explain usage
    - Uses rects, not perfect, other shapes, other pairings, docs

- Experiments:
    - Take code from before make collisions work, just do it in directory 4, easier
    - If 2 Stars collide, let them coallescse into 1
    - If you shoot a star, let it break apart if it's big, or disappear if it's very small
    - If you collide with a star, do something else

- Show off what you've achieved!
